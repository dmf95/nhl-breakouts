# 📁 Archived Scripts

The purpose of the `Archived Scripts` folder in this project is to store Python scripts that are no longer in use or have become obsolete. These scripts were once part of the project's development, but for various reasons, they are no longer relevant to the current project objectives.

Guidelines for managing archived scripts:
- 🚀 Scripts here are no longer actively used, so do not rely on them for current project tasks.
- 🧹 Consider documenting reasons for archiving or replacing scripts.
- 📁 Maintain an organized structure within this folder for easy reference.
- 📅 Periodically review and assess the need for retaining these scripts.
