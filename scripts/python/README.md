# 📁 Python Folder

The purpose of the `Scripts` folder in this project is to house Python scripts, both in the form of `.py` or `.ipynb` files. These scripts are not executed as part of the core project but are essential for auxiliary tasks like data analysis, scraping, and custom testing.

Inside this folder, you can find scripts for data analysis, helping uncover insights from project data. Data scraping scripts retrieve information from external sources or APIs. Custom test scripts assess project components for reliability.

Guidelines for using this folder:
- 📋 Keep things organized with clear, descriptive filenames.
- 📝 Document scripts for usage and dependencies.
- 🔄 Use version control (e.g., Git).
- 🔗 Specify dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.
- 🧪 Test scripts in isolation.
- 🔐 Consider security and privacy for scraping scripts.
